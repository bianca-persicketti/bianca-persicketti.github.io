My video answers my truism in that, even after one's certain that the candle flame was put out, it can still be relit just from sparks and the smoke coming off the wicks. They have to be dead, and not smoking to be out, and to be certain that the candle is out before that is to be a fool. 

My second video works in the same way, s my laptop is plugged in and I'm working on one of my projects like usual, without saving or anything. My laptop starts to shut off, and I mouse over the buttons carefully, even, and still slip, restarting the computer even as it gives me a second chance. My progress is then lost. 

I decided to use a Shephard Tone for my sound. It's an audio illusion, giving the listener a sense of anticipation and anxiety as the sound seems to infinitely grow higher in pitch, but never out of hearing range. It shows that you might at first be certain that the sound is rising in pitch, but it isn't.
